# Missle-Defense-Dr-Racket
User Guide-Line:
Red-Missles will be fired randomly from the top of the screen,
hit points will be deducted if any red missles lands, and the
game will terminate as long as hit points get to zero. Use your
mouse to indiate directions of defensing bullets you
want to fire.
